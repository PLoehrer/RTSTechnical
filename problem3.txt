#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform
(pick one), what would it be?

I would definitely change template error messages in C++. I used C++ for many
classes and projects in school, and template error messages were always
exceedingly difficult to decipher and handle. I distinctly remember spending most
of my debugging time in a class called Applied Software Design trying to fix
templating errors. That is not the only time I have had to deal with the problem
of template errors, just one specific example.
