#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform
(pick one), what would it be?

I would definitely change template error messages in C++. I used C++ for many
classes and projects in school, and template error messages were always
exceedingly difficult to decipher and handle. I distinctly remember spending most
of my debugging time in a class called Applied Software Design trying to fix
templating errors. Granted, this was one of my earlier experiences using
templates, but they did not get much easier to debug as time went on.
